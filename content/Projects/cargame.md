Much more successful attempt at online multiplayer. Players were able to join games, shoot each other, drive cars together without issue and run each other over. Unfortunately didn't go much further than that due to the million other issues matchmaking issues that come with online games. I could probably succeed now, but I think the intro cinematic was the most interesting part of the whole thing. I've thought a lot about revisiting that aspect of the project.
