Blockade Runner was a submission to Newgrounds' [List Jam](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/list-jam) and was developed over a weekend. Originally I wasn't really interested in participating, but then...

The main theme of the game was made in one sitting on the first day of the jam - but it wasn't made with the jam in mind! It ended up being such an inspiration that the rest of the game came into being solely so I could have something cool to showcase the track with.

The single-button controls made it easy to create new mechanics without having to worry about the player having the freedom to break things. 

Here's a zoomed out view of the game's main level.

I always wanted to do a follow-up project sometime down the line given how quickly the first one came together, but other things always took priority. A mobile game seemed like a pretty obvious fit, and I took plenty of notes about where a sequel could go. Maybe someday...

I'm also sitting on roughly a full album of completed songs for a soundtrack. Here's a couple of them:
