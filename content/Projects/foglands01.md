### Wow... It's been years!
Contrary to how it might seem, I'm STILL WORKING ON THIS! I've constantly gone back and forth about whether to talk more about the game publicly. Progress is slow and I've tried to avoid showing something that's half-baked or that might not even be used in the future. 

But enough time has passed that I think I finally have a clear idea of the core gameplay loop, the mood of the music and art direction, and the bits that are way out of the scope of what I can reasonably achieve. The game is STILL far from done, but I feel like I'd be shooting myself in the foot by continuing to not share more details about it.

Without further ado, enjoy this massive Foglands recap! I hope this will shed some light on what this stupid thing is about.

### Name change

This is more of a disclaimer than anything - and I've been mentioning it in passing for a while now - but I want to preface this by saying that the title "Foglands" definitely won't be what the final game is called. The name used to have some meaning ages ago, but it's mostly been a codename since then and doesn't have any thematic relevance. Plus there's already a PSVR game called "The Foglands" that came out a year or so ago.

I'll continue calling it Foglands as a codename for simplicity. I do have a name in mind but I'm keeping that under warps for now.


### Actual, real, honest-to-God gameplay footage



### Overview

Gameplay loop
- First person platformer
- Reliance on strong core movement mechanics, with the crown jewel being the grapple hook
	- Emphasis on gaining and maintaining momentum
	- Levels are littered with ways to build speed and move vertically
- Exploration focus within an interconnected world
	- Paths start out as linear, but the world grows as you unlock more powers
- Fast-paced combat system with emphasis on humor

Setting
- 

### Direction

I've been learning Blender and Unity's own ProBuilder plugin to get better at 3D modelling. Art hasn't ever really been my forte, but I love modeling environments.

Style
- Realistic lowpoly world with cartoony sprited characters. Contrast helps separate the two more clearly
- Heavy dithering in post-process (YouTube streaming quality killer)
- Crusty PS1 models with heavy vertex shading to provide detail
	- Emphasis on more realistic environments with photo textures
	- Ex: Resident evil, N64 beetle racing
- Typically dark and moody fantasy environments
