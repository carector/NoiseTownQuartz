Massive is my favorite. I use this thing all the time in all sorts of projects. I think it's important to know how to use one VST really well, and Massive has filled that role for me for almost a decade.

To me, the biggest thing massive has going for it is its 8 macro knobs. You can assign these to virtually any part of the synth, which makes it easy to automate any number of things at once.

Massive is extremely versatile, but I find that I use it most often to create basses and really heavy sub-basses. Every song on [[album1]] relied on it heavily.
