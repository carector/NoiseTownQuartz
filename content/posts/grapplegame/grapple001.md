It's been ages! I took a long break from posting things while I wrapped up college, but I've still been gradually chipping away at this game in the background. While it's *still* going to be a while before it's done, I think that - rather than keeping my lips sealed - I'd like to get in the habit of doing tiny weekly-ish updates to actually shed some light on what I'm working on.

I've always been a little hesitant to talk about this game out of fear that too much of what I show would change over time. In the past my standard of quality would improve enough that I wouldn't feel happy with a lot of the previous work I'd done. But now I've finally managed to hone in on everything I want to squeeze into this game, and I feel competent enough that I can achieve something I'd be satisfied with releasing. **From here on out you can expect these posts to provide a pretty good image of how the end result will look.**

With that out of the way... I guess it's time to **FINALLY** shed some light on what this game's actually about, wouldn't you say?

# Overview

## The 30-second pitch

Foglands is a first-person adventure / parkour game about you, some malnourished pirates, and a mysterious island you've been thrown deep into. Armed with a beat-up grapple hook, your main goal is to romp through the jungle, track down your captain and crew, then group up and get out of there. Easier said than done...
## Features
- An extensive movement kit that incentivizes high speed and interacting with your environment
- A sprawling interconnected world begging you to explore every nook and cranny
- Meaty one-hit-kill combat, complete with a wide array of tools and items to help get the job done
- Bleeding-edge slapstick comedy
## About the name...

I've said it a few times before, but **"Foglands" is just a working title** that I fully plan on changing. I have one name I've settled on, but I'll hold off until the game is further along before I make it official. For the time being I'll be referring to the project as ***GrappleGame*** to prevent ambiguity, since there's already [a similarly-named PSVR title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg4QRA30wTk) that released recently.

## Movement kit

One of the core philosophies of the game is focused on building up speed through a variety of means. Your **double jump, slide, clamber,** and **fast mantling** abilities pair nicely with your grappling hook to help you achieve this.

Your **grappling hook** is the centerpiece of your movement abilities. The moment-to-moment gameplay involves a lot of swinging across pits Spiderman-style, but there are many other opportunities to use it to interact with the environment. Late game upgrades also give the hook a real kick in the ass power-wise.
## Tools and items

In addition to the grapple hook, the player will be subject to a number of **tools / weapons** across the span of the game. The player can only hold one of these tools at a time. This helps create certain areas with a theme in mind while also barring the player off from certain areas until they've unlocked the necessary tool, encouraging backtracking and keeping sticky notes of interesting places for later. Tools can also assist in combat - but we'll get to that in a moment.

An example: The **prism** tool lets you cut through ropes and set flammable materials ablaze.

There are also single-use items that can all be grabbed and thrown if the player has their grapple hook out. Some of these items help in combat, others are required to solve puzzles, and a couple have no real purpose except to be kind of funny.

## Combat

Fodder enemies are also scattered across the linear segments and are mostly there for you to beat the crap out of them. They typically die in one or two hits and don't put up much of a fight, but can be a real threat in high numbers due to your own small health bar. Enemies and combat exist largely to complement your movement kit, to break up the monotony of longer parkour sections, and to play a small role in more elaborate puzzles.

## Levels

Exploration is a big theme I'm leaning into, and the island is designed with it in mind. The biggest concern of any level is to capitalize on the extensive movement kit as much as possible. As the player makes it further in the game, more and more paths become available to them, slowly but surely transforming the island into an interconnected network of routes and destinations.
