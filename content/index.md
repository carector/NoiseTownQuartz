You've entered my extra-special subdomain. Here you'll find behind the scenes looks at [projects](/Projects) I'm working on (and have worked on). I hope to write a few [tutorial](/Tutorials) posts to shed some light on various programming and music tricks I've learned over the years.

I also maintain a [notebook](/Notes) here where I publish my thoughts and random ideas for future projects. Don't even think about stealing them unless you can really knock it out of the park.
## Noteworthy projects
* [[Blockade Runner]]. Made in 2021 over the span of two days. A love letter to stick figure flash games. Ridiculous return on investment in terms of Newgrounds page views.
