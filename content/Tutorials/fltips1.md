### Favorite soundfonts
- SGM
- Mario Kart 64
- Super Mario Sunshine (killer accordions)

### Favorite free plugins
- Synth1: Free and with a huge number of presets available. I don't use this one too much but I know people who use it religiously.
- Wider: 1-knob stereo enhancer. A little lazy, but it's great if you're looking to add just a bit more oomph to something.
- GENNY: Beautiful Sega Genesis YM2612 sound chip emulator. 
- DVS Saxophone: **Don't.**
