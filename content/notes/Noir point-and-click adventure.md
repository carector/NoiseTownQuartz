### Gameplay
- Point and click puzzle game inspired by lucasarts games and Another World
- Two main parts to the gameplay
	- Escape room style point-and-click puzzle stuff
		- Take in only a few rooms at a time
		- Inventory system, drag-drop-combine items to solve puzzles
	- Quicktime button input escape sequences
		- Used to bookend puzzle sequences to keep player engaged
		- Similar to dragon's lair: Player needs to react quickly and moves through rooms pretty fast
			- Keyboard input instead of mouse - single button (space)? or arrow keys
		- Probably the most demanding in terms of art - still should take place against static backgrounds, but will feel more like watching an action sequence play out
### Setting and mood
- Setting inspirations
	- Dark City
### Visual style
- Low resolution, 1-bit black and white graphics
	- 256x192 upscaled 2x to 512x384
- Negative space and shadows to create optical illusions of sorts
- Visual inspirations
	- Sin City
	- Calvin and Hobbes Tracer Bullet strips
	- Samurai Jack ninja episode + that one season 5 opening shot
### Audio
- No music whatsoever (unless a very particular case arises)
- Driven by soundscapes, consider looking at FMOD
