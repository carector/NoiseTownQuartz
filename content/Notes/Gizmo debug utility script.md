- Add more intuitive debug gizmos for functions like boxcast / circlecast / raycast
- Create script that performs raycast functions and draws the debug info in the same frame
- Could include:
	- Physics.raycast/boxcast/spherecast/capsulecast - draw shapes at start and end, draw lines connecting
		- draw additional box when overlap/hit occurs?
	- OverlapBox / OverlapSphere - indicate where hits occur

- What builtin unity stuff could use more visual feedback?
