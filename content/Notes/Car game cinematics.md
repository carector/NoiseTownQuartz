**Goal**
- Get better at modeling environments and mimicking PS1 look
- Illustrate a story split across several characters, maybe told out of sequence
	- Inspiration: 100 Bullets, new guy every issue who has some connection to past events
- Show off music I like from smaller artists
- 5 to 10 quick 30-45 second animations
- Adult Swim bumpers on steroids
- Interactive website
	- Web app showing an overhead map view of the city with different location pinpoints
	- Clicking one will play the animation for that area

### The city
- Each animation or bump takes place at some location in the same big city
- After enough animations people should be able to stitch together what happens and where


Map first pass

Look / feel
- Grungy city
- Gross yellow sky
	- Hazy yellow-orange color palette in general, almost sepia
- Mostly car stuff
- Leans into noir sometimes
- Use of heavily processed photographs for background elements + textures
- Phase 1 Gorillaz
- 100 Bullets

Music
- Vary per character / faction / part of story?
- Categories
	- Disgusting gritty hip hop instrumentals
		- Buck 65
		- Red Ants
		- 
	- Very early-2000s techno / KMFDM industrial shit



START SMALL - do one or two
Would like to try prioritizing lesser known songs (support soundcloud artists + avoid copyright strikes)

- Something by Red Ants, probably something off Phobos Deimos
