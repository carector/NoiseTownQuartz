- Use three.js for visual side of things
- Get list of rules and make sure they can be satisfied
- Logic should be pretty easy
	- Can only stack on top of card if that card's value = this card's value + 1
	- King/Queen/Jack/Ace can just have numerical value
	- Only special behavior
		- King: Can move to place in empty columns
		- Ace: Can move to foundation slots
		
- More difficult things
	- Determining if no more moves can be made (not strictly needed)
